## What to Know about Different Hair Types
The hair follicle plays a significant role in determining hair type. The shape of the hair follicle determines the shape of the hair shaft and its growth direction, which ultimately affects the texture and curl pattern of the hair. For instance, a round hair follicle produces straight hair, while an oval-shaped follicle produces wavy hair, and a curved or hooked follicle produces curly or kinky hair.

Additionally, the number of hair follicles present on the scalp also affects hair type. People with a higher density of hair follicles tend to have thicker, coarser hair, while those with fewer follicles have thinner, finer hair.

#### 1.Straight Hair 
This hair type is characterized by its naturally straight appearance, and it is often shiny and smooth. Straight hair tends to be the most resilient to damage and is relatively easy to maintain.
#### 2.Wavy Hair 
This hair type falls between straight and curly hair and has a distinct S-shaped pattern. It is often voluminous and full, but it can be challenging to manage if it is not properly moisturized.
#### 3.Curly Hair
Curly hair is characterized by its coiled or spiral-shaped strands, and it can range from loose waves to tight ringlets. This hair type tends to be prone to frizz and dryness, requiring a lot of moisture to maintain its definition and shape.
#### 4.Coily Hair
Coily hair has tightly coiled strands forming a zigzag pattern. This hair type is usually very fragile and requires a lot of moisture to prevent breakage. Coily hair is often dense, which means that it can be challenging to detangle or style without the proper technique or products.


## Subcategories

 Within the four mentioned categories above, are various different subcatagories that help identify what your specific hair needs are.
 
Straight hair:

  - Type 1a: Fine and straight hair with no visible wave pattern.
  - Type 1b: Medium thickness straight hair with a slight bend at the ends.
  - Type 1c: Coarse and straight hair with a slight wave pattern.
  
Wavy hair:

  - Type 2a: Fine and loose S-shaped waves with a natural sheen.
  - Type 2b: Medium thickness hair with more defined S-shaped waves and a tendency to frizz.
  - Type 2c: Coarse hair with well-defined S-shaped waves and a tendency to frizz.
  
Curly hair:

  - Type 3a: Loose, well-defined curls with a soft texture.
  - Type 3b: Springy curls with a tighter curl pattern and a tendency to frizz.
  - Type 3c: Corkscrew curls with a tight curl pattern and a tendency to shrink when dry.
  
Coily hair:

  - Type 4a: Tight, well-defined coils that resemble a spring.
  - Type 4b: Z-shaped coils with less definition and more shrinkage than type 4a.
  - Type 4c: Zigzag or almost no visible curl pattern, with a very fragile texture and tight coils that can easily break.
  
  ## Issues 
  
 Hair can have a significant imapct on a persons confidence, self-esteem, and sense of identity.Choosing the wrong product can have negative affects on ones hair health. With all the different factors one must take in mind; hair type, density, all the different subcategories, damage levels, and even the climate you live in, choosing the right hair product can be hard. The amount of options when shopping in store and online is extensive, and can be expensive. The Hair industry in the US is reported to make $13.44bn annually, and is expected to grow by 1.17% every year. Black women, who tend to fall in the curly to coily categories, are reported to spend "9X more on ethnic hair products than non-black consumers of both genders".So what can we do to reduce the amount of trial an error in buying products and instead direct consumers directly to their holy grail?

 ## Solution: AI Hair Identification and Recomendation
 
 An AI system that can identify different hair types and recommend the perfect hair product would use a combination of image recognition and machine learning techniques. Here is an overview of how such a system could work:

- Data collection: The AI system would need a vast dataset of hair images with labels indicating the hair type, subcategory, and recommended hair products. 
          The  dataset should include images of people with different hair types, textures, and lengths.

 - Image recognition: The AI system would use image recognition algorithms to analyze the user's hair image and identify the hair type and subcategory. The              algorithm would look for patterns such as the shape of the curls, the thickness of the hair strands, and the amount of shine.

 - Machine learning: The AI system would use machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's hair type, subcategory, and other factors such as age, gender, and         hair goals. The system would learn from previous user interactions and feedback to make more accurate product recommendations.

 - Product recommendation: Based on the hair type and other factors, the AI system would recommend the perfect hair product or hair care routine. The                     recommendations could include hair products such as shampoos, conditioners, oils, and styling products, along with instructions on how to use them.

 - Feedback loop: The AI system would collect feedback from the user on the recommended products and adjust the recommendations over time based on the user's             feedback and results.

Overall, an AI system that can identify different hair types and recommend the perfect hair product would require a vast dataset, sophisticated image recognition and machine learning algorithms, and a feedback loop to continuously improve the recommendations. Such a system could revolutionize the way people care for their hair and help them achieve their hair goals more effectively. 

Users could even have the option to filter out products that contain certain ingredients, such as sulfates, silicones, or certain alcohols. They can choose their price range, or even have the system recommend products from their chosen selection of brands.
The image of their hair would only be from the back, protecting their privacy.
